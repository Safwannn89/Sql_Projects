# 📉 World Layoffs Data Analysis Project

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis using **SQL** to analyze global layoff data.

It transforms raw, messy data into clean, standardized information and extracts meaningful **business insights** about layoff trends across companies, industries, and time periods.

---

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about layoffs from companies worldwide, including:

- Company names and locations  
- Industry classifications  
- Number of employees laid off (total and percentage)  
- Dates of layoffs  
- Company funding stages  
- Countries and funds raised  

---

## 🧱 Project Structure

The project is divided into two main phases:

### 🔹 Phase 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (`laysoff_1.sql`)
Focuses on preparing raw data for analysis by addressing common data quality issues.

### 🔹 Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (`laysoff_2.sql`)
Explores cleaned data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights about global layoff patterns.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Process

### ✅ Duplicate Removal
- Created a staging table (`layoffs1`)  
- Used `ROW_NUMBER()` to detect duplicates  
- Removed records with `row_num > 1` to ensure data integrity  

### ✅ Data Standardization
- Used `TRIM()` to clean white spaces and periods in names  
- Standardized country, industry, and date formats using:

  ```sql
  TRIM(TRAILING '.' FROM country)
  STR_TO_DATE(date_column, '%m/%d/%Y')
  ```

### ✅ Handling Null & Blank Values
- Converted empty strings to `NULL`  
- Recovered missing industry data using **self-joins**  
- Removed rows where both `total_laid_off` and `percentage_laid_off` were null  

### ✅ Removing Temporary Columns
- Dropped `row_num` after duplicate cleanup to keep the dataset clean

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis

### Key Areas Explored:
- Companies with **maximum layoffs**  
- Companies with **100% layoffs (shutdowns)**  
- **Top ranked companies** by total layoffs  
- **Yearly and monthly** layoff trends  
- Patterns by **company stage** and **industry**  
- **Rolling sums** and `DENSE_RANK()` to track cumulative layoffs over time  

---

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### SQL Techniques Used:

- **Window Functions**: `ROW_NUMBER()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `SUM() OVER()`  
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**: For modular queries  
- **Data Manipulation**: `UPDATE`, `ALTER TABLE`, string/date functions  
- **Joins**: Self-joins for data completion and conditional joins  

---

## 💡 Key Insights Generated

- Identified the **most affected companies and industries**  
- Found **seasonal trends** in layoffs (monthly/yearly)  
- Explored the **impact of funding stages** on layoff severity  
- Highlighted companies consistently appearing in top layoff rankings
